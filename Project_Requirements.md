**Instructions**



Task 1: Flexible String Manipulation with Functions
Create a function called formatFullName that takes two parameters: firstName and lastName. The function should return the full name in the format lastName, firstName.
Format the firstName and lastName so that the first letter of each is always capatilized.
Add a condition that checks if either the first or last name is missing. If so, return a string saying “Invalid name input.”





Task 2: Mathematical Operations with Multiple Parameters
Write a function called calculateTotalCost that takes three parameters: price, quantity, and taxRate.
The function should calculate the total cost of items, including tax. Use the formula: totalCost = (price * quantity) * (1 + taxRate).
Ensure that price, quantity, and taxRate are all valid numbers. If any are invalid, return a string: “Invalid input.”


Task 3: Functions with Conditional Logic
Write a function called checkEligibility that takes two parameters: age and isEmployed. The function should check if a person is eligible for a program based on the following rules:
If the person is over 18 and employed, they are eligible.
If the person is over 18 but unemployed, they are conditionally eligible.
If the person is 18 or younger, they are not eligible.
Return an appropriate string message for each scenario.


Task 4: Refactoring for Reusability
Refactor the calculateTotalCost function from Task 2 to include an optional discount parameter. If the discount is provided, the function should subtract the discount from the total cost before applying tax.
If no discount is provided, calculate the total cost as before.
